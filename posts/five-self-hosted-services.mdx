As is tradition when a developer makes a personal blog, the very first entry _must_ be one which details the tech and hard work put into said blog. We need some justification for all the hours spent (whether or not there will be actual content to follow). This is that post.

In the early part of the year, I decided I wanted to make something in my free time. Something tangible, approachable, and something of my own. I've never had my own personal site before, so it was an obvious choice. In the spirit of George R. R. Martin's "Not a Blog", you'll notice I call the section "Posts", which doesn't seem to imply regular content as much as "Blog" does. ðŸ¤·

I also wanted it to be a learning experience from the ground up, as well as platform for continued learning. The latest framework, the latest utilities, the best practices of this decade, and the newest trending buzzwords I can toy around with. A few early goals I settled on:

- Minimalist
- Performant
- Clean Architecture
