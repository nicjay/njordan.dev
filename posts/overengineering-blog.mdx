As is tradition when a developer makes a personal blog, the very first entry _must_ be one which details the tech and hard work put into said blog. We need some justification for all the hours spent (whether or not there will be actual content to follow). This is that post.

In the early part of the year, I decided I wanted to make something in my free time. Something tangible, approachable, and something of my own. I've never had my own personal site before, so it was an obvious choice. In the spirit of George R. R. Martin's "Not a Blog", you'll notice I call the section "Posts", which doesn't seem to imply regular content as much as "Blog" does. ðŸ¤·

I also wanted it to be a learning experience from the ground up, as well as platform for continued learning. The latest framework, the latest utilities, the best practices of this decade, and the newest trending buzzwords I can toy around with. A few early goals I settled on:

- Minimalist
- Performant
- Clean Architecture

# The First Attempt

A proper static site generator is a top choice for all of those criteria. Plain old HTML, CSS, and a sprinkling of JavaScript is extremely fast and hard to beat. Eleventy (11ty) was just hitting version 1.0 around the time I was starting my creative venture, and it's what I went with at first. The talk of the net was glowing.

Spoiler: this site does not use 11ty (but not because it's bad).

My first mistake was forking from a very advanced [high-performance](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog) template created by a former Google engineer. Those four green 100 Lighthouse scores drew me right in. I like to understand the tools I use, so I spent a number of weeks deciphering the optimizations made, while simultaneously trying to cram in my own features like Tailwind support and dark mode.

I managed to get it to a point where I was satisfied, but realized I was far from mastery of the actual 11ty basics: templating, collections, shortcodes - you know, the reasons to use it in the first place. In retrospect, I didn't know

## 11ty/SSG

### Pros

- Very fast
- Very efficient
- [eleventy-img](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-img) is a best-in-class image optimizer

### Cons

- No TypeScript support
- No ESM Module support

The cons are in no way a criticism of 11ty. It serves its intended purpose extremely well, and I'd recommend it. I may even revisit it for my inevitable redesign.

# Rise and Fall

# The (Current) Stack

- Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Content: [MDX 2](https://mdxjs.com/) (with [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote))
- TBD

# Next.js

Next.js is not perfect. In particular, the official `next-image` utility leave a lot to be desired. My two biggest misses are the lack of build-time optimization, and the jankiness of trying to style it appropriately.
`next-future-image` takes some steps in the right direction, but it's not quite there yet.

# Conclusion

Is a full-on React framework (like Next.js) overkill for a site like this? Yes, absolutely. However, the developer experience is second to none, it has a huge ecosystem (being React), and its performance is great. Will I want to take another stab at 11ty, with hyper-optimzation in mind? At some point, probably.

TLDR; I wanted a cool blog, started with 11ty, then went Next.js. I may revisit 11ty someday.

# Beautiful Sites

A collection of very nicely designed personal sites I've come across. I've taken heavy inspiration from many of them.
